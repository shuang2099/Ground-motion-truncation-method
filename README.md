# Ground-motion-truncation-method
Time history analysis is considered as one of the most commonly used methods to evaluate the seismic performance of structures. But it is time-consuming for the computation cases such as complex structures and ground motions with long duration. Two ground motion truncation methods were proposed to save the computational time.
