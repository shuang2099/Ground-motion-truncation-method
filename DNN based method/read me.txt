The novel 2D-CNN-BiGRU based multi-input to single-output DNN model is established to predict the truncation point of ground motion, so that the computational efficiency of structural seismic response analysis is significantly improved in two aspects: (1) rapidly obtaining ground motion truncation points through efficient deep neural network algorithms during the prediction phase; (2) reducing computational workload and shortening analysis time during the time-history analysis phase by using the truncated ground motion records.
